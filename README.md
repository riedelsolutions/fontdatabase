[FontDatabase.app](https://fontdatabase.app) removes the hassle of finding the perfect font.


It's pretty much everyday that designers are completing a project, and ~~they~~ we think the typography we have in mind is great. Then we write whatever we need... and it looks awful. It's close to the idea we have in our minds, but you know close is not close *enough*.


FontDatabase lets you input the font you have in mind, and a parameterâ€” Do you need a font more minimal (sans-serif)? One that's more detailed (serif)? Do you want to be more liberal and get suggestions on more formal or informal fonts? FontDatabase gives you all these alternatives in seconds.


FontDatabase is the first product I made for my tech startup, [The M Company](https://TheMComp.com).

##Why not...?
FontDatabase isn't the only font suggestion tool that exists. It wasn't the first, and plenty more came after. So **what makes FontDatabase.app uniquely useful?**

Most tools use open font library APIs to give you a randomized suggestion. FontDatabase has a (as the name says) unique, manually curated database that suggests fonts that are actually useful for designers. I used my years of experience as a designer to slim down the choices so you get *only* useful results, consequently getting rid of the hassle of looking through hundreds and hundreds of useless fonts. 


##Why isn't [X Font] in here?
Since the database is manually curated, and there are potentially millions of fonts that could be in it, you most likely will eventually find that one of your favourite fonts isn't on the site. Please let us know and I'll add it in! You can reach me on [The M Company's Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/TheMComp) or via [email](mailto:contactthemcompany@gmail.com).
